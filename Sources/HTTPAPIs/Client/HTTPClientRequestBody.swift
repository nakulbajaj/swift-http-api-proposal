import AsyncStreaming

/// A type that represents the body of an HTTP client request.
///
/// ``HTTPClientRequestBody`` wraps a closure that encapsulates the logic
/// to write a request body. It also contains extra hints and inputs to inform
/// the custom request body writing.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ### Seekable bodies
///
/// If the source of the request body bytes can be not only restarted from the beginning,
/// but even restarted from an arbitrary offset, prefer to create a seekable body.
///
/// A seekable body allows the HTTP client to support resumable uploads.
///
/// ```swift
/// try await HTTP.perform(request: request, body: .seekable { byteOffset, writer in
///     // Inspect byteOffset and start writing contents into writer
/// }) { response, body in
///     // Handle the response
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Restartable bodies
///
/// If the source of the request body bytes cannot be restarted from an arbitrary offset, but
/// can be restarted from the beginning, use a restartable body.
///
/// A restartable body allows the HTTP client to handle redirects and retries.
///
/// ```swift
/// try await HTTP.perform(request: request, body: .restartable { writer in
///     // Start writing contents into writer from the beginning
/// }) { response, body in
///     // Handle the response
/// }
/// ```
